##### Understand Django by Matt Layman

link: https://www.mattlayman.com/understand-django/

I read a couple of chapters so far. It starts with a great theoretical introduction for novice web developers. However, the further you go, the more is knowledge to absorb in the form of theory and individual code snippets. 

It doesn't really work for me, as the snippets are disjointed from the project it is quite difficult for me to put all the elements together.

Maybe it will click later, but I think I'm more a "hands on" learner. I think I am going to take a break from Understand Django and try to follow some "project-oriented" tutorials.
